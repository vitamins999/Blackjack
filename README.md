# Blackjack

## What is this?

A simple console implementation of the game Blackjack, written in C#.

## What the rules?

Check them out [here](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/).

## Anything else to know?

Betting is now supported! You have a starting balance of 100.00 (in whatever is your machine's local currency) and can bet anything up to your balance. The balance goes up or down depending on whether you win or lose, and when it reaches 0, the game ends.

If you want to keep gambling, load up the program again and your money will be reset. Just like in real life.
